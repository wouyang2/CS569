Problem Description:
Phishing is a prevalent and evolving threat that targets unsuspecting people on multiple platforms. With the increasing reliance on mobile devices like smartphones, tablets, etc., mobile phishing has become a significant problem. Cybercriminals are now exploiting the limited screen space and users’ trust in mobile apps and websites which has lead to a higher success rate for these attacks compare to desktop platforms.Below are the targeted systems and vulnerabilites:
Target Environment: Mobile platforms (Android and iOS)
Vulnerabilities: human’s tendency to trust mobile interfaces and limitations in mobile security features
Existing Studies/Defenses: URL blacklists and browser filters that solve some phishing problems have limitations with new phishing sites that rapidly change domains
Project Scope: 
Our project aims to address this issue by developing a machine learning based defense strategy that can detect phishing attempts on mobile platforms. Our primary focus is to construct a prototype that can identify malicious URLs, suspicious app behaviors, message contents, and other social engineering patterns that are associated with phishing behaviors. By leveraging existing datasets and possibly collecting new data from mobile environments, we will train and evaluate the model to detect phishing attempts with high accuracy.
Motivation:
The increasing number of mobile phishing attacks and the lack of effective mobile defenses have prompted us to address this problem. Due to the limited resources available for real-time phishing detection (e.g., browser security features or robust 
application-level detection systems), mobile users often fall victim to phishing attacks. By developing lightweight machine learning-based detection models, we aim to reduce the risk of phishing attacks and improve the security of mobile communications. The project also allows us to apply machine learning in areas where rapid detection is critical, while exploring real-world security challenges.
List of Hardware/Software Needs:
We currently have access to the required machine learning tools (Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.) and mobile development environment (Android Studio). However, if available, we may need help to access larger phishing datasets.
